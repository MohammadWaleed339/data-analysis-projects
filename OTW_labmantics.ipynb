        "## **Introduction**  \n",
        "Understanding salary trends is crucial for job seekers, employers, analysts, and recruiters. Salary variations depend on several factors, including job roles, company size, location, and industry experience. This project aims to analyze salary trends across different roles and locations and build a predictive model that estimates salary ranges based on job attributes.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## **Business Objectives**  \n",
        "1. **For Job Seekers**: Provide insights into salary expectations for different job roles, helping professionals make informed career decisions.  \n",
        "2. **For Employers**: Assist companies in setting competitive salary benchmarks to attract and retain top talent.  \n",
        "3. **For Analysts & Researchers**: Offer data-driven insights into salary trends based on geography, experience, and industry.  \n",
        "4. **For Recruiters**: Aid in salary benchmarking and ensuring fair compensation practices across various job sectors.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## **Problem Statement**  \n",
        "The project focuses on answering key questions regarding salary variations:  \n",
        "- How does salary differ by job position (e.g., Data Scientist, Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer)?  \n",
        "- What impact does company size have on salary levels?  \n",
        "- How do salaries vary across different locations (e.g., San Francisco vs. Austin vs. New York)?  \n",
        "- Can we develop a predictive model that estimates salaries based on job attributes?  \n",
        "\n",
        "## **Methodology**  \n",
        "### **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**  \n",
        "- Collecting structured salary data from multiple sources, such as job portals, industry reports, and salary surveys. Here we have used the __Glassdoor Jobs Dataset__.\n",
        "- Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing job titles.  \n",
        "- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns, trends, and distributions in salary data.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Feature Engineering**  \n",
        "- Creating relevant features, including job role, experience level, location, company size, industry, and job type (remote, hybrid, in-office).  \n",
        "- Encoding categorical variables for effective machine learning model training.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Data Analysis & Insights**  \n",
        "- Identifying salary distributions for different job roles.  \n",
        "- Analyzing the impact of experience, company size, and location on salary variations.  \n",
        "- Visualizing salary trends using statistical and graphical techniques such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Predictive Modeling**  \n",
        "- Building regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict salary ranges based on job attributes.  \n",
        "- Evaluating models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).  \n",
        "- Fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve predictive accuracy.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## **Expected Outcomes**  \n",
        "- A detailed salary analysis dashboard providing insights for job seekers, employers, and recruiters.  \n",
        "- A salary prediction model that estimates salary ranges based on job attributes.  \n",
        "- Identification of key factors influencing salary variations.  "
